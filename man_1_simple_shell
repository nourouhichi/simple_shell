.SH DESCRIPTION
Welcome to NN Simple Shell project! This program is a simple shell that can be compiled and launched from the command line within any number of Linux versions. It contains the most basic features and functions found in the various shell programs.

.SH OVERVIEW
This Simple Shell project is a major team project conducted by Nour Taktak and Nour Ouhichi, students at Holberton School, for educational purposes. It consists of developing and making our own clone of DASH - Debian Almquist shell found in several versions of Ubuntu Linux. Though cloning of DASH was the general guidance, having the same exact functionalities and features was not the goal. The goal for us was to learn and develop various team and individual skills regarding coding and git.
